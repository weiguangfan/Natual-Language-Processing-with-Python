Accurately measure brand coverage
Accurately report on brand coverage by training a custom model to find client logos and products. This makes it easy to calculate impressions, instead of painstakingly trying to follow traditional and social media with manual processes.

Easily find content
Automatically generate a relevant list of images from thousands of sports images. You can train a custom model to identify sports events (for example, goals scored, penalties, and injuries) or identify teams and players by jersey (team logo and number).

Improve operational efficiency
Train a custom model that automatically classifies important objects (for example, tomatoes, pallets, and products) into relevant categories that you define.
